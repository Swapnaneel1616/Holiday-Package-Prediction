🧳 Wellness Tourism Package – Customer Purchase Prediction

Machine Learning | Classification | Marketing Optimization






📌 Project Overview

Trips & Travel.Com aims to expand its customer base by launching a new Wellness Tourism Package—a travel offering designed to promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Last year, only 18% of customers purchased any travel package, mainly due to random and high-cost marketing efforts.

This project applies machine learning to help the company target the right customers efficiently and reduce unnecessary marketing expenses.
